.SYNOPSIS
    Installs Visual Studio Code, the PowerShell extension, and optionally
    a list of additional extensions.

    PowerShell extension on your machine.  You may also specify additional
    extensions to be installed using the -AdditionalExtensions parameter.
    The -LaunchWhenDone parameter will cause VS Code to be launched as
    soon as installation has completed.

.PARAMETER Architecture
    A validated string defining the bit version to download. Values can be either 64-bit or 32-bit.
    If 64-bit is chosen and the OS Architecture does not match, then the 32-bit build will be
    downloaded instead. If parameter is not used, then 64-bit is used as default.

.PARAMETER BuildEdition
    A validated string defining which build edition or "stream" to download - stable or
    insiders edition. If the parameter is not used, then stable is downloaded as default.

.PARAMETER AdditionalExtensions
    An array of strings that are the fully-qualified names of extensions to be
    installed in addition to the PowerShell extension.  The fully qualified
    name is formatted as "<publisher name>.<extension name>" and can be found
    next to the extension's name in the details tab that appears when you
    click an extension in the Extensions panel in Visual Studio Code.

.PARAMETER LaunchWhenDone
    When present, causes Visual Studio Code to be launched as soon as installation
    has finished.

.PARAMETER EnableContextMenus
    When present, causes the installer to configure the Explorer context menus
