### PowerShell Extension Rename Disclaimer ###

PowerShell is not a statically typed language. As such, the renaming of functions, parameters, and other symbols can only be done on a best effort basis. While this is sufficient for the majority of use cases, it cannot be relied upon to find all instances of a symbol and rename them across an entire code base such as in C# or TypeScript.

There are several edge case scenarios which may exist where rename is difficult or impossible, or unable to be determined due to the dynamic scoping nature of PowerShell.

# Known Rename Limitations

- Renaming can only be done within a single file. Renaming symbols across multiple files is not supported.
