This extension provides rich [PowerShell][] language support for [Visual Studio Code][] (VS Code).
Now you can write and debug PowerShell scripts using the excellent IDE-like interface
that VS Code provides.

This repository, `vscode-powershell`, is the [Language Server Protocol][] client for VS
Code and [`PowerShellEditorServices`][] is the server (also used by other editors, such as
Emacs and Vim).

## Platform Support

The extension should work anywhere VS Code itself and PowerShell Core 7.2 or higher is
[supported][]. For Windows PowerShell, only version 5.1 is supported and only on a best-effort
basis. PowerShell Core 6, 7.0, and 7.1 have reached end-of-support. We test the following
configurations:

- **Windows Server 2022** with Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell Core 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4
- **macOS 12** with PowerShell Core 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4
- **Ubuntu 22.04** with PowerShell Core 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4

On Windows, we also test with and without Constrained Language Mode enabled.

Read the [installation instructions][]
to get more details on how to use the extension on these platforms.

For Windows PowerShell 5.1, [.NET Framework 4.8][dotnet-framework] or higher is required.

## Installing the Extension

The PowerShell extension can be installed from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace by
clicking the [**Install Button**][]. You can also install the PowerShell extension from
within VS Code by opening the **Extensions** view with keyboard shortcut
<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+X</kbd>, typing PowerShell, and selecting the extension.

We would encourage you to try the _pre-release_ version whenever possible. When a
_Pre-Release_ is available, it can be installed from the marketplace using the
**Switch to Pre-Release Version** button. You can switch back to the stable version of the
extension by using the **Switch to Release Version** button that will appear. You can also
downgrade to other versions of the extension using the arrow next to the **Uninstall**
button and choosing **Install Another Version**.
