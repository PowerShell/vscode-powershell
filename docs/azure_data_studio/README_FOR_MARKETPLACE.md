that Azure Data Studio provides.

## Platform support

- **Windows 7 through 10** with Windows PowerShell v3 and higher, and PowerShell Core
- **Linux** with PowerShell Core (all PowerShell-supported distributions)
- **macOS** with PowerShell Core

Read the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/wiki/FAQ) for answers to common questions.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting

- IntelliSense for cmdlets and more
- Rule-based analysis provided by [PowerShell Script Analyzer](http://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer)
- Go to Definition of cmdlets and variables

- Document and workspace symbol discovery
- Run selected selection of PowerShell code using <kbd>F8</kbd>
- Launch online help for the symbol under the cursor using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>
- Basic interactive console support!

## Installing the Extension

You can install the official release of the PowerShell extension by following the steps
in the [Azure Data Studio documentation](docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions).
In the Extensions pane, search for "PowerShell" extension and install it there.  You will
get notified automatically about any future extension updates!

You can also install a VSIX package from our [Releases page](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/releases) and install it through the command line:

```powershell
azuredatastudio --install-extension PowerShell-<version>.vsix
```

## Reporting Problems

If you experience any problems with the PowerShell Extension, see
[the troubleshooting docs](./docs/troubleshooting.md) for information
on diagnosing and reporting issues.

#### Security Note
For any security issues, please see [here](./docs/troubleshooting.md#note-on-security).

## Example Scripts

There are some example scripts in the extension's `examples` folder that you can
use to discover PowerShell editing and debugging functionality.  Please
check out the included [README.md](examples/README.md) file to learn more about
how to use them.

This folder can be found at the following path:

```powershell
$HOME/.azuredatastudio/extensions/ms-vscode.PowerShell-<version>/examples
```

or if you're using the preview version of the extension

 ```powershell
$HOME/.azuredatastudio/extensions/ms-vscode.powershell-preview-<version>/examples
```

To open/view the extension's examples in Visual Studio Code, run the following from your PowerShell command prompt:

```powershell
code (Get-ChildItem $Home\.azuredatastudio\extensions\ms-vscode.PowerShell-*\examples)[-1]
```

### SQL PowerShell Examples
In order to use these examples (below), you need to install the SqlServer module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer).

```powershell
Install-Module -Name SqlServer -AllowPrerelease
```

In this example, we use the `Get-SqlInstance` cmdlet to Get the Server SMO objects for ServerA & ServerB.  The default output for this command will include the Instance name, version, Service Pack, & CU Update Level of the instances.

```powershell
Get-SqlInstance -ServerInstance ServerA, ServerB
```

Here is a sample of what that output will look like:

```
Instance Name             Version    ProductLevel UpdateLevel
-------------             -------    ------------ -----------
ServerA                   13.0.5233  SP2          CU4
ServerB                   14.0.3045  RTM          CU12
```

In this example, we will do a `dir` (alias for `Get-ChildItem`) to get the list of all SQL Server instances listed in your Registered Servers file, and then use the `Get-SqlDatabase` cmdlet to get a list of Databases for each of those instances.

```powershell
dir 'SQLSERVER:\SQLRegistration\Database Engine Server Group' -Recurse |
WHERE { $_.Mode -ne 'd' } |
FOREACH {
    Get-SqlDatabase -ServerInstance $_.Name
}
```

Here is a sample of what that output will look like:

```
Name                 Status           Size     Space  Recovery Compat. Owner
                                            Available  Model     Level      
----                 ------           ---- ---------- -------- ------- -----

tempdb               Normal       72.00 MB   61.25 MB Simple       140 sa   
WideWorldImporters   Normal         3.2 GB     2.6 GB Simple       130 sa   
```

This example uses the `Get-SqlDatabase` cmdlet to retrieve a list of all databases on the ServerB instance, then presents a grid/table (using the `Out-GridView` cmdlet) to select which databases should be backed up.  Once the user clicks on the "OK" button, only the highlighted databases will be backed up.

```powershell
Get-SqlDatabase -ServerInstance ServerB |
Out-GridView -PassThru |
Backup-SqlDatabase -CompressionOption On
```

This example, again, gets list of all SQL Server instances listed in your Registered Servers file, then calls the `Get-SqlAgentJobHistory` which reports every failed SQL Agent Job since Midnight, for each SQL Server instances listed.

```powershell
dir 'SQLSERVER:\SQLRegistration\Database Engine Server Group' -Recurse |
WHERE {$_.Mode -ne 'd' } |
FOREACH {
    Get-SqlAgentJobHistory -ServerInstance  $_.Name -Since Midnight -OutcomesType Failed
}
```
