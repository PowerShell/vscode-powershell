# Azure Data Studio Docs

[Azure Data Studio](https://github.com/Microsoft/azuredatastudio) is a VSCode-like IDE primarily targeted at database administrators and is a fork of VSCode. Since it's a fork of VSCode, many extensions "just work" including the PowerShell extension.

This folder contains any docs for PowerShell extension support in Azure Data Studio.

Table of Contents:

* `README.md` - This file. It's purely for information about this folder and shouldn't be used elsewhere.
* `README_FOR_MARKETPLACE.md` - The markdown file that will be shown when you look at the PowerShell extension in the Azure Data Studio marketplace.
