## What are snippets

Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements. Check out the [VSCode documentation on snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets). It provides an overview and instructions on how to author snippets. It's really simple - just a little bit of JSON.

### Table of contents

You need to add an item to the table of contents. The addition should follow the *alpha ordering* of the list.
The ToC item template looks like this:

```md
| [Name of snippet](link to header of your snippet): _some short description_ |
```

An example looks like this (NOTE: all lowercase link):

```md
| [PSCustomObject](#pscustomobject): _A simple PSCustomObject_ |
```

which will show up in the ToC like this:

| Table of Contents |
