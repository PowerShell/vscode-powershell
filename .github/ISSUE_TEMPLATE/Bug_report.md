<!--

BEFORE SUBMITTING A NEW ISSUE, PLEASE READ THE TROUBLESHOOTING DOCS!
https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/tree/master/docs/troubleshooting.md

IMPORTANT: you can generate a bug report directly from the
PowerShell extension in Visual Studio Code by selecting
"PowerShell: Upload Bug Report to GitHub" from the command palette.

NOTE: If you have both stable (aka "PowerShell") and preview (aka "PowerShell Preview") installed,
you MUST DISABLE one of them for the best performance.
Docs on how to disable an extension can be found here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_disable-an-extension

The more repro details you can provide, along with a zip
of the log files from your session, the better the chances
are for a quick resolution.

You may also want to record a GIF of the bug occurring and
attach it here by dropping the file into the description body.

### System Details

<!--
To help diagnose your issue, the following details are helpful:
- Operating system name and version
- VS Code version
- PowerShell extension version
- Output from `$PSVersionTable`

To get this information, run the following expression in your Integrated Console and paste the output here inside the backticks below:

& {"### VSCode version: $(code -v)"; "`n### VSCode extensions:`n$(code --list-extensions --show-versions | Out-String)"; "`n### PSES version: $($pseditor.EditorServicesVersion)"; "`n### PowerShell version:`n$($PSVersionTable | Out-String)"}


If you are running VSCode Insiders, use this expression instead (and paste the result inside the backticks):

& {"### VSCode version: $(code-insiders -v)"; "`n### VSCode extensions:`n$(code-insiders --list-extensions --show-versions | Out-String)"; "`n### PSES version: $($pseditor.EditorServicesVersion)"; "`n### PowerShell version:`n$($PSVersionTable | Out-String)"}
