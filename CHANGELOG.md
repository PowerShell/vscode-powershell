## v2024.2.1
### Tuesday, April 16, 2024

With PowerShell Editor Services [v3.20.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/releases/tag/v3.20.0)!

Hotfix for incorrect signing certificate, sorry about that!

Also removed Plaster integration as we were unable to correctly sign it since we no longer own it.

See more details at the GitHub Release for [v2024.2.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/releases/tag/v2024.2.1).

## v2024.2.0
### Monday, April 08, 2024

With PowerShell Editor Services [v3.19.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/releases/tag/v3.19.0)!

New stable release!

This release comes with PSReadLine v2.4.0-beta0 and PSScriptAnalyzer v1.22.0.

It includes an overhauled support for Terminal Shell Integration,
so it always supports VS Code's latest features!

The codebase was cleaned up by the removal of several deprecated features.
Multiple bugs were fixed in the shutdown process,
default debugger configurations and IntelliSense.
A setting was added to allow the exclusion of the execution policy CLI argument at startup,
so that users in restricted environments are better able to launch the extension.

This release went through three pre-releases.
Thank you so much to all our beta testers and users for your contributions.

## v2023.8.0
### Wednesday, October 11, 2023

This one took a while! As always, these changes were available in the pre-release channel
which went through six versions to get us to today's release.

The `cwd` setting now supports `~` for home directory, relative paths, and named workspace
folders. The `additionalPowerShellExes` setting also now supports `~`, checks for missing
extensions if necessary, and both settings smartly strip surrounding quotes from the
user-supplied value. These two settings are now far more user-friendly.

Thanks to efforts across the team, we are shipping the extension with the latest and
greatest PSReadLine, `v2.3.4`!

The extension commands AKA `$psEditor` API was reworked and no longer mangles path casing.
It also now exposes the `CloseFile` and `SaveFile` methods, and supports multi-root
workspaces.

A new setting `integratedConsole.startLocation` was added to control the Extension
Terminal's starting position. Thanks @krishankanumuri!

To wrap things up, another crash when `$ErrorActionPreference = "stop"` was resolved. A
race condition for the language status item's name and icon was fixed. Our telemetry went
down after a package upgrade which required a cross-team effort to resolve (it's now also
cleaned up to send just what we're using). The DSC breakpoints capability now works as
intended without causing module load errors or emitting "sticky" progress information. A
bug when the log level was set to `None` broke the server was fixed. Our server's major
dependency, OmniSharp's `csharp-language-server-protocol`, was updated to v0.19.9 which
means we can now use the current LSP spec v3.17. We had to work with the project to
resolve a serialization regression. Finally, a lot of various build improvements were
made.

Please note the change in our versioning schema: the middle version number no longer
corresponds to the month, but is simply incremented. Even versions are stable, and odd
versions are pre-release, with the latter purposefully being versioned higher than the
former in order to keep both channels available in the Visual Studio Code marketplace.

Thanks to all the many community contributors whose efforts make releases such as these
possible!

## v2023.6.0
### Tuesday, June 06, 2023

This release focused on fixing the "disappearing output" bug present in PowerShell 5.1,
where an old bug with the `Out-Default` cmdlet's `TranscribeOnly` flag could cause the
Extension Terminal to stop displaying output. While the root cause in the cmdlet is fixed
upstream, that fix is only in PowerShell Core, and not backported to Windows PowerShell.
We were able to workaround the bug with a very careful use of reflection to reset the
flag's value at the appropriate times (see the three takes it took to get this right).

We also refactored the client's startup logic so that it should be impossible to create a
ghost Extension Terminal, and the error handling and logging was given a thorough cleanup.
Finally, two noisy bugs were fixed: when completions are canceled the useless error
message is no longer produced, and when the DSC module is only loaded in one attempt
instead of repeatedly.

Please enjoy these bugfixes! We sure enjoy making the extension more stable.

### Wednesday, May 03, 2023

This release focused on include Justin Grote's new "attach .NET debugger" debug
configuration for binary PowerShell modules, and on handling start-up failures more
gracefully. If the start-up fails because the configured PowerShell is out-of-date,
instead of a confusing "undefined" error message we now detect the problem, inform the
user with a pop-up message of it, and offer to open the installation and/or update
instructions.

## v2023.3.3
### Thursday, March 30, 2023

This is primarily a bug-fix focused release, and we want to say thanks to all our loyal
preview extension users! The "PowerShell Preview" extension has now been officially
deprecated, with "preview" releases now available via the "pre-release" option on the
stable "PowerShell" extension in the marketplace. While you should be migrated
automatically, feel free to just uninstall the preview and install the now one-and-only
extension, but please keep testing our pre-releases! This change makes it much simpler to
use, as you no longer have to switch between two different extensions and instead can use
VS Code's marketplace to install your choice of version!

### Thursday, February 23, 2023

#### [vscode-powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell)

Primarily an update to v3.8 of PowerShell Editor Services, as previewed over February.
Includes a massive enhancement to extension's symbol support, nearly completing the
[Consistent References][] project, with the final work in an upcoming preview. Enjoy!

[Consistent References]: https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/projects/13

#### [PowerShellEditorServices](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices) v3.8.1

- ✨ 📁 [vscode-powershell #2112](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/1995) - Add `WorkspaceFolders` and use it when enumerating files.
- ✨ 🙏 [vscode-powershell #1481](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/1993) - Count `${Function:My-Function}` as a function reference.

- 🐛 🙏 [PowerShellEditorServices #1989](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/1989) - Keep only first assignment as declaration.
- ✨ 🐢 [PowerShellEditorServices #1988](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/1988) - Support Run/Debug tests in PSKoans-files. (Thanks @fflaten!)

In the PR below we rewrote all the symbol logic. Classes (and their properties and
methods) are now proper symbols. Instead of a dozen similar-yet-different Abstract Symbol
Tree (AST) PowerShell script visitors handling different parts of each symbol-related
request, we have a single visitor that builds a cached dictionary of symbols for each
file. This was a massive simplification of the code that also leads to huge performance
improvements across all the symbol related features:

- [Go to Symbol in Workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/editingevolved#_open-symbol-by-name)
- [Go to Symbol in Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-symbol)

Please try it out and give us feedback! There's plenty of room for more improvement, and
this will be much easier going forward.

## v2023.1.0
### Wednesday, January 18, 2023

First stable release for the new year, includes a multitude of fixes for the debugger!
Expanding variables with properties that are inaccessible no longer causes a short-circuit
preventing the rest of the properties from being expanded, variable values whose expansion
results in PowerShell code being executed now works as expected, and in general all the
correct properties are now present. We look forward to adding the ability to view static
and private fields in a future update.

## v2022.11.0
### Wednesday, November 16, 2022

The November release represents a renewed focus on the client, that is, the TypeScript
extension for Visual Studio Code. We've paid back a significant amount of technical debt
by enabling both the TypeScript compiler's and ESLint linter's strict checks, helping us
ensure we are writing correct code. We've increased the client's logging, made the
walkthrough's installation instructions cross-platform, added a warning popup when custom
configured additional PowerShell executables aren't found, and fixed a couple debugger
configuration edge cases.

A regression for the `OnIdle` handler was fixed in the server, complete with regression
tests covering the registration and triggering of idle events registered both in a profile
and during a session. A workaround was implemented for a completion bug in PowerShell that
was causing the LSP session to disconnect when used with third-party clients. When
executing scripts, the path is now escaped with single quotes instead of double quotes,
addressing the edge case where a path contains a dollar sign, and is now inline with
PowerShell's semantics.

The build is now correctly published in release mode which should be more performant and
won't allow the user to accidentally enable the "wait for debugger" scenario (which can
appear as a hang, though it is a correctly working feature that is now hidden behind more
developer settings). Additionally, checks were added to both the server and client build
pipelines to assert that the bits are in release mode before packaging, as it was
unfortunately the act of running the tests that erroneously and silently overwrote release
bits with debug bits.

Finally, a long-standing bug that often prevented the server from starting with Windows
PowerShell was resolved. Known to users as the `DryIoc` error (which was a misleading
stacktrace that commonly popped up), we tracked down a broken dependency of OmniSharp that
when present and loaded into the GAC caused a type resolution error. While it took a year
for us to find the root cause, the fix was a single line dependency update for OmniSharp,
and then some work to incorporate the OmniSharp update into the server.

## v2022.10.0
### Thursday, October 20, 2022

This October stable release incorporates a number of bugfixes throughout September and
early October, though is not based on the latest preview, v2022.10.1-preview, as the
refactors involved in enabling TypeScript's strict type checking and ESLint's strict
linting will need more testing. However, based on the success of the PowerShell Script
Analyzer's [v1.21.0][pssa-v1.21] release we wanted to get this to you sooner!

Highlighted bugfixes include: supporting events registered to PowerShell's `OnIdle`
handler so that Azure cmdlets such as `Az.Tools.Predictor` now work, a lock around the
client's `start()` so the extension terminal cannot accidentally be spawned multiple
times, and making the default debug configurations not override your current working
directory (by unsetting `cwd` on all of them).

In addition to fixing bugs, we also reintroduced a fan-favorite feature: the PowerShell
Language Status Icon will visually indicate if the execution pipeline is busy. For
example, a long-running task in the PowerShell Extension Terminal or a launched editor
command will show a spinner!

Finally, I wanted to call out work by Patrick to significantly improve the performance of
reference finding (which powers the reference code lenses), so large workspaces can now be
used more easily. If these performance improvements are still not enough for a particular
workspace, we also introduced two new settings to fine-tune the feature:

- `powershell.analyzeOpenDocumentsOnly` when enabled will only search for references within open documents
- `powershell.enableReferencesCodeLens` can be used to disable reference finding without having to turn off other code lenses

## v2022.5.0
### Tuesday, May 03, 2022

#### [vscode-powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell)

Welcome to the new and improved PowerShell for Visual Studio Code!

This update represents a complete overhaul of the core PowerShell engine of PowerShell
Editor Services, intending to create a more reliable and stable user experience. This
release represents nearly two years' work, tracked in PSES
[#1295](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/1295) and
implemented in PSES
[#1459](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/1459). It is our
response to many issues opened by users over the last several years.

Thank you to all of the community members who opened issues which helped motivate this
major update.

These major updates have also been tested over the last 6 months, in 13 releases of our
[PowerShell Preview extension for Visual Studio
Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.powershell). A
huge thank you to all of the community members who have tested these changes to the
extension and have worked with us to polish the extension before releasing it through our
stable channel.

Please see our
[blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/major-update-to-the-powershell-extension-for-visual-studio-code)
for more details!

Candidate! Please give it a thorough test.

### Monday, April 18, 2022

This is our first Release Candidate. We've merged a set of major fixes to the debugger so
that attaching to remote processes / runspaces now works again. While the extension is not
perfect (yet), we believe at this point the preview far exceeds the stable extension in
terms of usability and stability, and it is time to roll this out. Please give this a
thorough testing, as we hope to roll it into the stable extension next week.

### Tuesday, April 12, 2022

We delayed moving the preview branch to stable in order to fix issues surrounding our
`ReadKey` / `ReadLine` logic. This preview contains a new minor release of PowerShell
Editor Services with an entire rewrite of that logic, utilizing what we hope is a much
better workaround for the underlying issue in .NET's `Console.ReadKey`. Please give this
release a thorough testing, especially in the console with PSReadLine.

## v2021.10.3-preview
### Thursday, October 28, 2021

#### [vscode-powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell)

No changes! New preview for PowerShell Editor Services v3.0.0!

#### [PowerShellEditorServices](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices)

This preview release includes a complete overhaul of the core PowerShell engine
of PowerShell Editor Services.
This represents over a year's work,
tracked in [PSES #1295](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/1295)
and implemented in [PSES #1459](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/1459),
and is our answer to many, many issues
opened by users over the last few years.
We're hoping you'll see a marked improvement
in the reliability, performance and footprint
of the extension as a result.

Previously the Integrated Console was run
by setting threadpool tasks on a shared main runspace,
and where LSP servicing was done with PowerShell idle events.
This lead to overhead, threading issues
and a complex implementation intended to work around
the asymmetry between PowerShell as a synchronous,
single-threaded runtime and a language server
as an asynchronous, multi-threaded service.

Now, PowerShell Editor Services maintains its own dedicated pipeline thread,
which is able to service requests similar to JavaScript's event loop,
meaning we can run everything synchronously on the correct thread.
We also get more efficiency because we can directly call
PowerShell APIs and code written in C# from this thread,
without the overhead of a PowerShell pipeline.

This change has overhauled how we service LSP requests,
how the Integrated Console works,
how PSReadLine is integrated,
how debugging is implemented,
how remoting is handled,
and a long tail of other features in PowerShell Editor Services.

Also, in making it, while 6,000 lines of code were added,
we removed 12,000,
for a more maintainable, more efficient
and easier to understand extension backend.

While most of our testing has been re-enabled
(and we're working on adding more),
there are bound to be issues with this new implementation.
Please give this a try and let us know if you run into anything.

We also want to thank [@SeeminglyScience](https://github.com/SeeminglyScience)
for his help and knowledge as we've made this migration.

Finally, a crude breakdown of the work from the commits:

- An initial dedicated pipeline thread consumer implementation
- Implement the console REPL
- Implement PSRL idle handling
- Implement completions
- Move to invoking PSRL as a C# delegate
- Implement cancellation and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>
- Make <kbd>F8</kbd> work again
- Ensure execution policy is set correctly
- Implement $PROFILE support
- Make nested prompts work
- Implement REPL debugging
- Implement remote debugging in the REPL
- Hook up the debugging UI
- Implement a new concurrent priority queue for PowerShell tasks
- Reimplement the REPL synchronously rather than on its own thread
- Really get debugging working...
- Implement DSC breakpoint support
- Reimplement legacy readline support
- Ensure stdio is still supported as an LSP transport
- Remove PowerShellContextService and other defunct code
- Get integration tests working again (and improve diagnosis of PSES failures)
- Get unit testing working again (except debug service tests)

## v2021.10.2

work is under review.

## v2021.9.2
### Thursday, September 30, 2021

This release includes changes from both the `v2021.9.1-preview` and `v2021.9.2-preview`.
There were no changes made to PowerShell Editor Services, but several several bugfixes
made to the extension, and most notably, the extension code is now properly minified and
bundled. This should result in a faster and more reliable extension.

#### [vscode-powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell)

## v2021.9.0
### Thursday, September 09, 2021

This release includes changes from both `v2021.8.3-preview` and `v2021.9.0-preview`.

A new `stopDebugger` notification was added that allows PowerShell Editor Services,
the LSP module, to stop an attached UI debugger (such as VS Code's)
for debugger sessions started by executing code with a `PSBreakpoint` attached.
This may not work in all cases but should improve usability.

The PowerShell status bar indicator no longer uses custom coloring but instead pulls from the user's theme.
A formatting bug was fixed by community maintainer Patrick Meinecke.
A regression in the debug launch configuration's `script` parameter was fixed and covered with a test.
And finally, the bundled [PSScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/releases/tag/1.20.0)
was updated to `v1.20.0`.

## v2021.8.2
### Tuesday, August 24, 2021

This release also contains all changes listed in [v2021.8.1-preview](#v202181-preview)
below. Notably it fixes several major issues when debugging scripts that were caused by
threading deadlocks in both PowerShell Editor Services and its library, [OmniSharp's C#
Language Server Protocol][omnisharp] that we resolved by setting the compiler to treat
[CA2007][] as an error. This allowed us to programmatically fix _every_ awaited task to
use `.ConfigureAwait(false)` and so avoid deadlocks caused by the introduction of new
synchronization contexts in user code (such as the use of `System.Windows.Forms`). By
fixing this through a compiler rule, we effectively prevent the issue from recurring.
Additionally, we not only added a full regression test for this scenario but also
re-enabled all the prior `DebugService` unit tests in PowerShell Editor Services.

While there is still much work to do, we are making significant headway on improve the
debugger's reliability, one of our current project focuses. See the [Debugger Reliability
Project](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/projects/9) for our progress.

```json
"[powershell]": {
    "editor.wordSeparators": "`~!@#$%^&*()-=+[{]}\\|;:'\",.<>/?"
}
```

#### [PowerShellEditorServices](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices)

from the previous version v0.18.3, released in November 2020. OmniSharp is the underlying
Language Server Protocol and Debug Adapter Protocol server library, and as such is our
biggest dependency. This update brings us to the LSP 3.16 and DAP 1.48.x specifications,
enabling us to start incorporating all the latest LSP changes, and it includes numerous
bug fixes and enhancements resulting in a faster and more stable server and extension
experience.

#### Release of preview work to stable branch

This release, coinciding with the [GA release of PowerShell 7](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-PowerShell-7-0/),
brings a year of work on the PowerShell extension into the stable release.
The timing of this release is deliberate, since some of the new features
depend on additions and bugfixes in PowerShell 7,
while others have a much better experience in PowerShell 7
thanks to many improvements shipping with it.

Some changes that come to the stable channel in this release include:

- [Integration of PSReadLine into the Integrated Console](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-PowerShell/issues/535),
  enabling syntax highlighting, a better (and more configurable) completion experience,
  multiline editing and searchable history in the PowerShell Integrated Console
- Performance and reliability improvements gained
  by [replacing](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/1056)
  a hand-rolled Language Server Protocol stack
  with the LSP server library from the Omnisharp project
- An [ISE compatibility mode](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/pull/2335)
  setting to toggle a more ISE-like user experience
- Debugging improvements in PowerShell 7,
  [using its new debugging APIs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/1119)
- [End of support for PowerShell v3/v4 and .NET 4.5.2](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-PowerShell/issues/1310)

After this release, the stable/preview channels will now function as originally intended,
where the preview channel will be the beta release
for features to come out in the following stable release.

You may also notice that the history of the changelog has changed.
For a full list of changes between this release and the previous stable release,
see [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/blob/main/docs/preview_to_stable_changelog.md).

## v2019.11.0
### Friday, November 1, 2019

#### Special Note
In this release of the preview extension,
we've merged significant architectural work into PowerShell Editor Services.
After several months of work, PSES now uses the Omnisharp LSP library
to handle Language Server Protocol interaction instead of rolling its own,
allowing PSES to concentrate on being a good PowerShell backend.
We hope you'll see increased performance and stability in this release.
As always, [please let us know if you find any issues](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/new/choose).

## v2.0.0-preview.1
### Wednesday, January 23, 2019

#### Preview builds of the PowerShell extension are now available in VSCode

We are excited to announce the PowerShell Preview extension in the VSCode marketplace!
The PowerShell Preview extension allows users on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell Core 6 to get and test the latest updates
to the PowerShell extension and comes with some exciting features.

The PowerShell Preview extension is a substitute for the PowerShell extension so
both the PowerShell extension and the PowerShell Preview extension should not be enabled at the same time.

By having a preview channel, in addition to our existing stable channel, we can get new features out faster and get feedback faster from you, the users.

##### How to Get/Use the PowerShell Preview extension

If you dont already have VSCode, start [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/setup/setup-overview).

Once you have VSCode open, click `Clt+Shift+X` to open the extensions marketplace.
Next, type `PowerShell Preview` in the search bar.
Click `Install` on the `PowerShell Preview` page.
Finally, click `Reload` in order to refresh VSCode.

If you already have the PowerShell extension, please disable it to use the Powershell Preview extension.
To disable the PowerShell extension, find it in the Extensions sidebar view, specifically under the list of Enabled extensions,
Right-click on the PowerShell extension and select `Disable`.
Please note that it is important to only have either the PowerShell extension or the PowerShell Preview extension enabled at one time.
![How to Disable](https://github.com/PowerShell/powershell.github.io/blob/master/PowerShell-Blog/Images/disable-extension.jpg)

#### What the first preview contains

The v2.0.0-preview.1 version of the extension is built on .NET Standard
(enabling support for both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core from one assembly)

It also contains PSReadLine support in the integrated console for Windows behind a feature flag.
PSReadLine provides a consistent and rich interactive experience,
including syntax coloring and multi-line editing and history, in the PowerShell console, in Cloud Shell,
and now in VSCode terminal. For more information on the benefits of PSReadLine,
check out their [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psreadline/about/about_psreadline?view=powershell-6).

To enable PSReadLine support in the Preview version on Windows, please add the following to your user settings:

```json
"powershell.developer.featureFlags": [ "PSReadLine" ]
```

HUGE thanks to @SeeminglyScience for all his amazing work getting PSReadLine working in PowerShell Editor Services!

#### Breaking Changes

As stated above, this version of the PowerShell extension only works with Windows PowerShell versions 5.1 and PowerShell Core 6.

### Wednesday, June 21, 2017

#### New HTML content view commands enabling custom UI tabs

You can now show editor tabs with custom HTML-based UI by using the
new HTML content view commands!  This is the first step toward UI
extensions for VS Code written in PowerShell.

Here's an example:

```powershell
$view = New-VSCodeHtmlContentView -Title "My Custom View" -ShowInColumn One
Set-VSCodeHtmlContentView -View $view -Content "<h1>Hello world!</h1>"
Write-VSCodeHtmlContentView $view -Content "<b>I'm adding new content!</b><br />"
```

And here's the result:

![HTML view demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79405/27394133-f96c38cc-565f-11e7-8102-a3727014ea5a.GIF)

Check out the cmdlet help for the following commands to learn more:

- `New-VSCodeHtmlContentView`
- `Show-VSCodeHtmlContentView`
- `Close-VSCodeHtmlContentView`
- `Set-VSCodeHtmlContentView`
- `Write-VSCodeHtmlContentView`

Since this is a first release, we've restricted the use of JavaScript
inside of the HTML.  We will add this capability in a future release!

#### Code formatting setting presets for common styles

We've now added code formatting presets for the most common code style
conventions used in the PowerShell community:

- **[OTBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS_.28OTBS.29)** -
  Known as the "One True Brace Style". Causes `else`, `catch`, and other
  keywords to be "cuddled", keeping them on the same line as the previous
  closing brace:

  ```powershell
  if ($var -eq $true) {
    # Do the thing
  } else {
    # Do something else
  }
  ```

- **[Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_Stroustrup)** -
  Causes beginning curly braces to be placed on the same line as the statement:

  ```powershell
  if ($var -eq $true) {
    # Do the thing
  }
  else {
    # Do something else
  }
  ```

- **[Allman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style)** - All curly braces are preceded by a newline:

  ```powershell
  if ($var -eq $true)
  {
    # Do the thing
  }
  else
  {
    # Do something else
  }
  ```

- **Custom** - Allows full customization of the code formatting settings.

In addition, code formatting now respects your `editor.insertSpaces` and
`editor.tabSize` settings!

#### Debugging in a temporary PowerShell Integrated Console

We've added the ability to debug your PowerShell code in a temporary
PowerShell Integrated Console so that you have a fresh runspace and
PowerShell process each time you hit F5!

This setting is necessary if you are developing with PowerShell 5
classes or modules using .NET assemblies because .NET types cannot
be reloaded inside of the same PowerShell process.  This new setting
saves you from reloading your PowerShell session each time you debug
your code!

You can configure this behavior in two ways:

- Use the `launch.json` configuration parameter `createTemporaryIntegratedConsole`:

  ```json
  {
    "type": "PowerShell",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "PowerShell Launch Current File in Temporary Console",
    "script": "${file}",
    "args": [],
    "cwd": "${file}",
    "createTemporaryIntegratedConsole": true
  },
  ```

- Configure the setting `powershell.debugging.createTemporaryIntegratedConsole`:

  ```json
  "powershell.debugging.createTemporaryIntegratedConsole": true,
  ```

The default value for these settings is `false`, meaning that the temporary
console behavior is **opt-in**.

Configuring the user or workspace setting will cause all debugging sessions
to be run in a temporary Integrated Console so it's useful if you would prefer
this to be the default behavior.  The `launch.json` setting overrides the user
setting so you can always customize the behavior for a specific launch
configuration.

#### NewFile() API and Out-CurrentFile command

You can now create a new untitled file from within the Integrated Console
by using the `$psEditor.Workspace.NewFile()` command!  Also, you can send
the formatted output of any PowerShell command to the current file by using
the `Out-CurrentFile` command:

```powershell
Get-Process | Out-CurrentFile
```

Special thanks to [Doug Finke](https://github.com/dfinke) for the contribution!

#### Other fixes and improvements

- [#881](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/pull/881) -
  When you select a different PowerShell version in the session menu, your choice
  is persisted to the `powershell.powerShellExePath` setting.

- [#891](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/891) -
  Pester CodeLenses now run tests without string interpolation of test names

## 1.3.0
### Friday, June 9, 2017

#### CodeLens for running and debugging Pester tests

We've added two new CodeLens actions that show up above Describe blocks in
your Pester tests, "Run tests" and "Debug tests".  By clicking one of these
CodeLenses, your tests will be executed in the Integrated Console with
the debugger attached.  You can now set breakpoints and quickly debug a portion
of your test script:

![Pester CodeLens](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79405/26988706-3c054ed0-4d05-11e7-87f0-5bbf16ee73ef.GIF)

#### CodeLens support for finding references of a function or cmdlet

We've also added CodeLenses for showing the number of references for a function or
cmdlet that is defined in a script.  If you click this CodeLens, the references
pane will appear so that you can navigate through all of the references:

![References CodeLens](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79405/26989245-384a4866-4d07-11e7-9c1e-076dbd7d6eb4.GIF)

We will add CodeLens support for PowerShell 5+ classes and class methods in a future
update!

#### Document symbol support for Pester tests

We've also added document symbol support for Pester tests so that you can easily
navigate among the Describe, Context, and It blocks in large Pester script files:

![Pester symbols](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79405/26989077-91e7a306-4d06-11e7-8e26-916bb78720f8.GIF)

#### New PowerShell ISE theme

We now include a new color theme that tries to provide a faithful interpretation
of the PowerShell ISE's style, including a blue console background!  To use this
theme open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), run the "Preferences: Color Theme"
command, then select "PowerShell ISE".

![ISE theme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79405/26988805-9769aea6-4d05-11e7-81fc-da79bf1ec3cb.png)

This is a first attempt at making this happen so [give us feedback](https://git.io/v9jnL)
if you think that the colors can be improved! Super huge thanks to
[Matt McNabb](https://twitter.com/mcnabbmh) for putting this together!

#### New cmdlets inside the Integrated Console

Thanks to new PowerShell Editor Services co-maintainer [Patrick Meinecke](https://github.com/SeeminglyScience),
we've gained a new set of useful commands for interacting with the $psEditor APIs
within the Integrated Console:

- [Find-Ast](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Find-Ast.md)
- [Get-Token](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Get-Token.md)
- [ConvertFrom-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/ConvertFrom-ScriptExtent.md)
- [ConvertTo-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/ConvertTo-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Set-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Set-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Join-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Join-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Test-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Test-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Import-EditorCommand](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Import-EditorCommand.md)

This should also resolve the issues some people were seeing when we tried
to load the unsigned temporary script containing `Register-EditorCommand`
on machines with an AllSigned execution policy ([#784]([https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/784])).

#### Fixes and improvements

- [#827](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/827) -
  Fixed an issue where an Output panel will appear with an error when you close
  the PowerShell Integrated Terminal

## 1.2.1
### Thursday, June 1, 2017

#### Fixes and improvements

- [PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices#478](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/478) -

  untitled file

- [#807](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/807) -
  The users's previously selected PowerShell session type is now retained
  when running the "PowerShell: Restart Current Session" command.

- [#821](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/821) -
  Note properties on PSObjects are now visible in the debugger's Variables
  view

## 1.2.0
### Wednesday, May 31, 2017

#### Dynamic comment-based help snippets now work inside functions ([#763](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/748))

You asked for it, you got it!  Dynamic comment-based help snippets now work
inside function definitions, both above the `param()` block and at the end
of the function body:

![Comment help GIF](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/26637844/6e76cfa6-45d5-11e7-89b8-a2d6a559536b.GIF)

*NOTE: There is an issue where parameter sections don't get generated inside of a function
with a `[CmdletBinding()]` attribute.  This is being tracked at [PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer#768](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/issues/768).*

#### Session menu now contains entries for PowerShell Core installations on Windows ([#794](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/794))

It's now much easier to switch between Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core installs
on Windows.  When you run the "PowerShell: Show Session Menu" command or click the
PowerShell version indication in the status bar you'll now see PowerShell Core entries
in the menu:

![Session menu](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/26637984/d177f5f8-45d5-11e7-9def-705b3fa68953.png)

#### Improved PSScriptAnalyzer marker display and suppression snippets ([#781](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/781)) and ([#783](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/783))

The green squiggle markers you receive from PSScriptAnalyzer now include the
name of the corresponding rule in their description:

![Rule name](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/26638073/15aaaaae-45d6-11e7-93a0-cf6d5397553e.png)

This is really helpful with the new rule suppression snippets contributed by
[Jos Verlinde](https://github.com/Josverl)!  You can access them by typing
`suppress-` and selecting one of the suppression snippet options:

![Suppress rule](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/26638390/d8c42164-45d6-11e7-8844-a34a314654a5.GIF)

#### New built-in Pester problem matcher ([#798](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/798))

We now include a built-in [problem matcher](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks#_defining-a-problem-matcher)
for Pester test output so that you don't need to define one in your `tasks.json`
file any longer! You can reference the built-in problem matcher in your test
tasks by using the name `$pester`:

```json
    {
        "taskName": "Test",
        "suppressTaskName": true,
        "isTestCommand": true,
        "showOutput": "always",
        "args": [ "Invoke-Pester -PesterOption @{IncludeVSCodeMarker=$true}" ],
        "problemMatcher": "$pester"
    }
```

*NOTE: There is an issue with problem matchers when using the new `2.0.0`
version of VS Code's task runner.  Pester errors may show up multiple
times in the Problems panel.  This issue is being tracked at
[#797](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/797).*

#### Other fixes and improvements

- [#710](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/710) -
  Variable definitions can now be found across the workspace

- [#771](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/771) -
  Improved dynamic comment help snippet performance in scripts with many functions

- [#786](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/786) -
  Running the "Show Integrated Console" command will now start the extension
  if it isn't already started

- [#774](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/774) -
  Pressing Enter now causes custom prompt functions to be fully evaluated

- [#770](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/770) -
  Fixed issue where custom prompt function might be written twice when
  starting the integrated console

- [#767](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/767) -
  Fixed placeholder navigation for many built-in snippets

- [#782](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/782) -
  Fixed extension host crash when restarting the PowerShell session

- [#737](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/737) -

- [#777](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/777) -
  Changed "Starting PowerShell" message to clearly indicate that we're in the
  PowerShell Integrated Console

## 1.1.0
### Thursday, May 18, 2017

#### New dynamic snippet for adding comment-based help ([#748](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/748))

We've added a really cool new feature that enables you to create comment-based
help blocks with ease!  When you've defined a function in a PowerShell script
file, you can now start typing a comment block above the function definition
and it will be completed for you:

![Help Comment GIF](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/26216440/f31a47c8-3bb8-11e7-9fbc-7e3fb596c0ea.GIF)

This comment block works like a snippet, allowing you to tab through the fields
to quickly add documentation for the parts you care about.

This is a first pass for this feature and we plan to do more with it in the future.
Please feel free to [file feature requests](https://git.io/v9jnL) for anything else
you'd like to see!

#### Breakpoints hit in the Integrated Console now activate the debugger UI ([#619](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/619))

In previous releases it was necessary to start the "PowerShell Interactive Session"
debugging configuration before you could run a command or script from the Integrated
Console and hit breakpoints in the editor UI.  We've just removed this limitation!

Now when you set a breakpoint using `Set-PSBreakpoint` and run a script or command in the
Integrated Console, the debugger UI now gets activated:

![Debugger Activate GIF](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/26217019/d17708f2-3bba-11e7-982f-4d481c2cf533.GIF)

Note that breakpoints set in the Integrated Console [still do not show up](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/660)
in the editor UI; this requires [changes to VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8642)
that we'll be contributing for their next feature release.

#### Improved output when loading profile scripts ([#663](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/663) and [#689](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/689))

We now write the errors and Write-Output calls that occur while loading profile
scripts so that it's easier to diagnose issues with your profile scripts.  This
fix will help us identify the things missing from the Integrated Console which
cause your profile scripts to fail (like the current lack of a [PrivateData object for setting console colors](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/571)).

Please feel free to [file issues](https://git.io/v9jnL) for anything that causes
your profile scripts to throw errors when they get loaded!

#### Other fixes and improvements

- [#751](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/751) -
  Removed keybinding for the "Find PowerShell Modules from the Gallery" command
  because it conflicts with VS Code's default "Format Selection" keybinding.

- [#739](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/739) -
  Fixed wording of PowerShell extension commands to have consistent capitalization.
  Thanks to [@AndySchneiderDev](https://github.com/AndySchneiderDev) for the
  contribution!

#### New script argument UI when debugging ([#705](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/705))

You can now set PowerShell debugger configurations to prompt for arguments to be
passed to your script when it is executed.  This is configured using the new
`${command:SpecifyScriptArgs}` configuration variable in `launch.json`:

```json
        {
            "type": "PowerShell",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "PowerShell Launch DebugTest.ps1 w/Args Prompt",
            "script": "${workspaceRoot}/DebugTest.ps1",
            "args": [ "${command:SpecifyScriptArgs}" ],
            "cwd": "${file}"
        }
```

When you launch this configuration you will see a UI popup asking for arguments:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5177512/25560503/e60e9822-2d12-11e7-9837-29464d077082.png)

You can type your arguments to the script as you would in PowerShell:

```powershell
-Count 5
```

In future executions of this configuration, you will be presented with the arguments
you typed the last time you ran it so that you can easily edit them and test variations!

#### New hash table alignment formatting rule ([#672](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/672))

We've added a new code formatting rule that automatically aligns the equal sign
in assignments of keys in hash tables or DSC configurations.  It also works with
nested hash tables! Here's a simple example:

##### Before

```powershell
$formatTest = @{
    Apple = 4
    Tangerine = @{
        Orange = 2
        CornflowerBlue = 6
    }
    Banana = 3
}
```

##### After

```powershell

$formatTest = @{
    Apple     = 4
    Tangerine = @{
        Orange         = 2
        CornflowerBlue = 6
    }
    Banana    = 3
}
```

This formatting rule is enabled by default but can be disabled with the following
setting:

```json
"powershell.codeFormatting.alignPropertyValuePairs": false
```

#### Added basic module-wide function references support

In the past, finding the references or definition of a function in `FileA.ps1` only
worked if `FileA.ps1` had an explicit dot-source invocation of `FileB.ps1`.  We have
removed this limitation so that you can now find definitions and references of any
function across all the script files in your project folder!  This is especially
useful if you write PowerShell modules where all of the source files are dot-sourced
inside of the .psm1 file.

This new implementation is very basic and may give unexpected results, so please [file
an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues) if you get
a result you did not expect!

#### Other integrated console and debugger improvements

- Fixed [#698](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/698) -
  When debugging scripts in the integrated console, the cursor position should now
  be stable after stepping through your code!  Please let us know if you see any
  other cases where this issue appears.

- Fixed [#626](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/626) -
  Fixed an issue where debugging a script in one VS Code window would cause that script's
  output to be written to a different VS Code window in the same process.

- Fixed [#618](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/618) -
  Pressing enter on an empty command line in the Integrated Console no longer adds the
  empty line to the command history.

- Fixed [#617](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/617) -
  Stopping the debugger during a prompt for a mandatory script parameter no
  longer crashes the language server.

- Fixed [PowerShellEditorServices #428](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/428) -
  Debugger no longer hangs when you stop debugging while an input or choice prompt is
  active in the integrated console.

## 0.12.2
### Friday, April 7, 2017

- Fixed [#662](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/662) -
  Changed usage of `$env:PSMODULEPATH` to `$env:PSModulePath` to conform to
  a recent change in PowerShell 6 ([PowerShell/PowerShell#3255](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/3255))
  which makes the casing of `PSModulePath` consistent between Windows and
  the *NIX platforms.

  **NOTE: This is a breaking change for PowerShell extension users on Linux and macOS**

  If you are using PowerShell 6.0.0-alpha.17 or lower you **will** need to upgrade
  to 6.0.0-alpha.18.

- Fixed [#645](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/645) -
  "Go to Definition" or "Find References" now work in untitled scripts without
  crashing the session
- Fixed [#632](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/632) -
  Debugger no longer hangs when launched while PowerShell session is still
  initializing
- Fixed [#655](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/655) -
  Fixed an issue with current working directory being set incorrectly when
  debugging untitled script files
- Fixed [PowerShellEditorServices #430](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/430) -
  Resolved occasional IntelliSense slowness by preventing the implicit loading
  of the PowerShellGet and PackageManagement modules.  This change will be reverted
  once a bug in PackageManagement is fixed.
- Fixed [PowerShellEditorServices #427](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/427) -
  Fixed an occasional crash when requesting editor IntelliSense while running
  a script in the debugger
- Fixed [PowerShellEditorServices #416](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/416) -
  Cleaned up errors that would appear in the `$Errors` variable from the use
  of `Get-Command` and `Get-Help` in IntelliSense results

## 0.12.1
### Tuesday, April 4, 2017

- Fixed [#648](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/648) -
  Resolved an error when launching an untitled script file in a workspace
  with no launch.json or in a window without a workspace path

## 0.12.0
### Tuesday, April 4, 2017

#### Debugging untitled files ([#555](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/555))

You can now debug untitled files that are set to the PowerShell language mode.  When you
create a new untitled file, use the "Change Language Mode" command (<kbd>Ctrl+K M</kbd>)
and choose "PowerShell" from the menu that appears.  You can now press F5 to start
debugging the script file without saving it.

In the upcoming 1.11.0 release of Visual Studio Code (or in the current VS Code Insiders
release), you can configure the new `files.defaultLanguage` setting to `powershell` in either
your User or Workspace settings to cause all untitled files to be created with the PowerShell
mode by default.  This will allow you to create new PowerShell scripts and debug them
immediately without saving first!

#### New right-click context menu for Run Selection ([#581](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/581))

By user request, we've also added a new "Run Selection" item in the right-click context menu
for PowerShell script files:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/24670885/a18513fe-1924-11e7-91d3-dc14c6cbfad9.png)

#### Debugging improvements

- Fixed [#620](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/620) -
  PowerShell session now does not crash when a breakpoint is hit outside of
  debug mode

- Fixed [#614](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/614) -
  Auto variables are now populating correctly in the debugger.  **NOTE**: There is
  a known issue where all of a script's variables begin to show up in the
  Auto list after running a script for the first time.  This is caused by
  a change in 0.11.0 where we now dot-source all debugged scripts.  We will
  provide an option for this behavior in the future.

- Fixed [#641](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/641) -
  PowerShell script files with capitalized extensions (.PS1, .PSM1) can now
  be launched in the debugger

- Fixed [#616](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/616) -
  Debugger now shows column position indicators when debugging pipelines or
  nested expressions:

  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/24316990/2157480e-10b0-11e7-8a61-19fde63edfb7.png)

#### Integrated console improvements

- Fixed [PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices#411](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/411) -
  Commands run outside of the integrated console prompt now interrupt the prompt
  correctly.  This resolves a class of issues that appear when running commands
  in the extension like "New Project from Plaster Template" or any `$psEditor`
  commands added with the "Register-EditorCommand" function.  Running any of
  these commands will now cause the current input prompt to be cancelled so that
  the command's output will be written correctly.

#### Code formatting improvements

- Fixed [#595](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/595) -
  High CPU usage when using formatOnType has now been resolve

- Fixed [#559](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/559) -
  The `newLineAfterCloseBrace` behavior has been improved to respect common syntax
  usages

- Fixed[PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices#380](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/380) -
  The `whitespaceBeforeOpenBrace` behavior now leaves "magic" functions with the
  correct formatting.  For example: `(0 .. 10).foreach{$_}` now does not have a
  whitespace inserted before the `{`.

#### New Project with Plaster improvements

- Fixed [#643](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/643) -
  Running Plaster using the New Project command now interrupts the command prompt
  correctly

- Fixed [#504](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/504) -
  Confirming default values in Plaster input prompts by pressing Enter now works
  correctly

#### Other fixes and improvements

- Added [#639](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/pull/639) and
        [#640](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/pull/640) -
  Our configuration setting descriptions have been edited for superior clarity
  thanks to [June Blender](https://github.com/juneb)!

- Fixed [#611](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/pull/640) -
  Example-* snippets are now displaying correctly in IntelliSense results

- Added [#624](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/pull/624) -
  When you update the PowerShell extension after this release, you will now see
  version update indicators which offer to display the changelog in a preview
  tab

## 0.11.0
### Wednesday, March 22, 2017

#### Remotely edited files can now be saved

- Added [#583](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/583) -
  When you open files in a remote PowerShell session with the `psedit` command,
  their updated contents are now saved back to the remote machine when you save
  them in the editor.

#### Integrated console improvements

- Fixed [#533](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/533) -
  The backspace key now works in the integrated console on Linux and macOS.  This
  fix also resolves a few usability problems with the integrated console on all
  supported OSes.

- Fixed [542](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/542) -
  Get-Credential now hides keystrokes correctly on Linux and macOS.

We also added some new settings ([#580](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/580),
[#588](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/588)) to allow fine-tuning
of the integrated console experience:

- `powershell.startAutomatically` (default: `true`) - If true, causes PowerShell extension
  features to start automatically when a PowerShell file is opened.  If false, the user must
  initiate startup using the 'PowerShell: Restart Current Session' command.  IntelliSense,
  code navigation, integrated console, code formatting, and other features will not be
  enabled until the extension has been started.  Most users will want to leave this
  setting to `true`, though it was added to save CPU cycles if you often use new VS Code
  instances to quickly view PowerShell files.

- `powershell.integratedConsole.showOnStartup` (default: `true`) - If true, causes the
  integrated console to be shown automatically when the PowerShell extension is initialized.

- `powershell.integratedConsole.focusConsoleOnExecute` (default: `true`) - If `true`,
  causes the integrated console to be focused when a script selection is run or a
  script file is debugged.

#### Interactive debugging improvements

- Added [#540](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/540) -
  The scripts that you debug are now dot-sourced into the integrated console's
  session, allowing you to experiment with the results of your last execution.

- Added [#600](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/600) -
  Debugger commands like `stepInto`, `continue`, and `quit` are now available
  in the integrated console while debugging a script.

- Fixed [#596](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/596) -
  VS Code's Debug Console now warns the user when it is used while debugging
  a script.  All command evaluation now happens through the integrated console
  so this message should help alleviate confusion.

#### Other fixes and improvements

- Fixed [#579](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/579) -
  Sorting of IntelliSense results is now consistent with the PowerShell ISE
- Fixed [#591](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/591) -
  "Editor commands" registered with the `Register-EditorCommand` function are
  now sorted alphabetically by their `Name` field, causing commands to be grouped
  based on their source module.
- Fixed [#575](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/575) -
  The interactive console no longer starts up with errors in the `$Error` variable.
- Fixed [#599](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/599) -
  The [SSASCMDLETS module](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh213141.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396)
  from SQL Server Analytics Service should now load correctly in the integrated
  console.

## 0.10.0
### Tuesday, March 14, 2017

#### New interactive console experience

We are excited to provide you with the first release of our new interactive
console experience!  When you open up a PowerShell script file, you will
be greeted with a new VS Code integrated terminal window called
"PowerShell Integrated Console"

![integrated console screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/23910661/b599f2ee-0897-11e7-9426-00af794c10b5.png)

In this console you will have an experience that falls somewhere between
the PowerShell ISE and the PowerShell console host:

- Tab completion of commands and their parameters
- Basic command history, accessed using the up/down arrow keys
- The `psedit` command opens existing files in an editor pane
- Pressing <kbd>F8</kbd> in an editor pane runs the current line or selection in the console
- Native applications like `git` are fully supported
- Script debugging shares the same console session with the editor for
  a true ISE-like debugging experience

It even works with your fancy prompt function if configured in your
VS Code profile (`$HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.VSCode_profile.ps1`):

![custom prompt screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/23910654/b1bca66c-0897-11e7-81b1-70eff5b97c21.png)

The integrated console is supported on PowerShell v3 through v6 and works
on Linux and macOS with PowerShell Core.  By default you don't have to
configure which PowerShell to run, we will pick an appropriate default
based on your platform.  If you'd like to choose a different install
of PowerShell you can always change the `powershell.developer.powerShellExePath`
setting.

Keep in mind that this is the first release for this feature and there are
bound to be issues and missing functionality.  Please feel free to file
GitHub issues for any bugs or feature requests!

##### Known Issues and Limitations

- [#535](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/535) PSReadline
  is currently **not** supported in the integrated console.  We will enable this
  in a future release.
- [#534](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/534) Integrated console
  prompt is not restarted when you stop the debugging of a local runspace in another
  process.  This will be addressed soon in a patch update.
- [#533](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/533) Backspace key
  does not work in the integrated console on Linux and macOS.  The workaround for now
  is to use <kbd>Ctrl+H</kbd> instead of the Backspace key.  This will be addressed
  soon in a patch update.
- [#536](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/536) Integrated console
  sometimes does not have a scrollbar at startup.  The workaround is to resize the width
  of the VS Code window slightly and the scrollbar will appear.  This will be addressed
  soon in a patch update.

#### Get-Credential and PSCredential support

Now that we have the integrated console, we have added support for the `Get-Credential`
cmdlet, `Read-Host -AsSecureString`, and any input prompt of type `SecureString` or `PSCredential`.
When you run any of these cmdlets you will be prompted inside the integrated console:

![credential screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/23910668/bac9019c-0897-11e7-80e2-eaf1b9e507f8.png)

#### Code formatting improvements

We now support VS Code's `editor.formatOnType` setting so that your code gets formatted
as you type!  Formatting will be triggered when you press Enter or the closing curly
brace character `}`.

Based on your feedback, we've also added new code formatting options, all of which
are turned on by default:

- `powershell.codeFormatting.newLineAfterCloseBrace` - Causes a newline to be inserted
  after a closing brace in multi-line expressions like if/else
- `powershell.codeFormatting.whitespaceBeforeOpenBrace` - Causes whitespace to be
  inserted before an open brace like `Foreach-Object {`
- `powershell.codeFormatting.whitespaceBeforeOpenParen` - Causes whitespace to be
  inserted before an open parentheses like `if (`
- `powershell.codeFormatting.whitespaceAroundOperator` - Causes whitespace to be
  inserted around operators like `=` or `+`
- `powershell.codeFormatting.whitespaceAfterSeparator` - Causes whitespace to be
  inserted around separator characters like `;` and `,`
- `powershell.codeFormatting.ignoreOneLineBlock` - Single-line expressions, like
  small if/else statements, will not be expanded to multiple lines.

We've also made many improvements to the performance and stability of the formatter.

#### Debugging improvements

We've added a new configuration for debugging your Pester tests.  By default it
merely runs `Invoke-Pester` at the workspace path, but you can also edit the
configuation to add additional arguments to be passed through.

We've also added support for column breakpoints.  Now you can set a breakpoint
directly within a pipeline by placing your cursor at any column on a line and
running the `Debug: Column Breakpoint` command:

![column breakpoint screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/23910649/aaef70e4-0897-11e7-93b7-0d729969a1e2.png)

For the latest PowerShell Core release ([6.0.0-alpha.17](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v6.0.0-alpha.17)),
we have also added the ability to step into ScriptBlocks that are executed on another
machine using `Invoke-Command -Computer`.

Set a breakpoint on an `Invoke-Command` line and then once it's hit:

![Invoke-Command screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/23911032/c01b8ff6-0898-11e7-89e3-02a31d419fc5.png)

Press `F11` and you will step into the ScriptBlock.  You can now continue to use
"step in" and trace the ScriptBlock's execution on the remote machine:

![remote script listing screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/23918844/ca86cf28-08b1-11e7-8014-c689cdcccf87.png)

Note that you cannot currently set breakpoints in the script listing file as
this code is being executed without an actual script file on the remote machine.

#### Other fixes and improvements

- Fixed [#427](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/427) -
  The keybinding for "Expand Alias" command has been changed to <kbd>Shift+Alt+E</kbd>
- Fixed [#519](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/519) -
  Debugger hangs after continuing when watch expressions are set
- Fixed [#448](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/448) -
  Code formatter should keep indentation for multi-line pipelines
- Fixed [#518](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/518) -
  Code formatter fails when dollar-paren `$()` expressions are used
- Fixed [#447](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/447) -
  Code formatter crashes when run on untitled documents

## 0.9.0
### Thursday, January 19, 2017

#### New PowerShell code formatter

We've added a formatter for PowerShell code which allows you to format an
entire file or a selection within a file.  You can access this formatter by
running VS Code's `Format Document` and `Format Selection` commands inside
of a PowerShell file.

You can configure code formatting with the following settings:

- `powershell.codeFormatting.openBraceOnSameLine` - Places open brace on the
  same line as its associated statement.  Default is `true`.
- `powershell.codeFormatting.newLineAfterOpenBrace` - Ensures that a new line
  occurs after an open brace (unless in a pipeline statement on the same line).
  Default is `true`
- `editor.tabSize` - Specifies the indentation width for code blocks.  This
  is a VS Code setting but it is respected by the code formatter.
- `editor.formatOnSave` - If true, automatically formats when they are saved.
  This is a VS Code setting and may also affect non-PowerShell files.

Please note that this is only a first pass at PowerShell code formatting, it
may not format your code perfectly in all cases.  If you run into any issues,
please [file an issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/new)
and give us your feedback!

#### Streamlined debugging experience - launch.json is now optional

**NOTE: This improvement depends on VS Code 1.9.0 which is due for release
early February!** However, you can try it out right now with the [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)
release.

Thanks to a new improvement in VS Code's debugging APIs, we are now able to
launch the PowerShell debugger on a script file without the need for a `launch.json`
file.  You can even debug individual PowerShell scripts without opening a
workspace folder!  Don't worry, you can still use a `launch.json` file to configure
specific debugging scenarios.

We've also made debugger startup much more reliable.  You will no longer see the
dreaded "Debug adapter terminated unexpectedly" message when you try to launch
the debugger while the language server is still starting up.

#### Support for debugging remote and attached runspaces

We now support remote PowerShell sessions via the [`Enter-PSSession`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/5.0/microsoft.powershell.core/enter-pssession)
cmdlet.  This cmdlet allows you to create a PowerShell session on another machine
so that you can run commands or debug scripts there.  The full debugging
experience works with these remote sessions on PowerShell 4 and above, allowing
you to set breakpoints and see remote files be opened locally when those breakpoints
are hit.

For PowerShell 5 and above, we also support attaching to local and remote PowerShell
host processes using the [`Enter-PSHostProcess`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/5.0/microsoft.powershell.core/enter-pshostprocess)
and [`Debug-Runspace`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/5.0/microsoft.powershell.utility/debug-runspace)
cmdlets.  This allows you to jump into another process and then debug a script that
is already running in one of the runspaces in that process.  The debugger will break
execution of the running script and then the associated script file will be opened
in the editor so that you can set breakpoints and step through its execution.

We've also added a new `launch.json` configuration for debugging PowerShell host processes:

![Process launch configuration screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/22089468/391e8120-dda0-11e6-950c-64f81b364c35.png)

When launched, the default "attach" configuration will prompt you with a list of
PowerShell host processes on the local machine so that you can easily select one
to be debugged:

![Process selection UI screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/22081037/c205e516-dd76-11e6-834a-66f4c38e181d.png)

You can also edit the launch configuration to hardcode the launch parameters, even
setting a remote machine to connect to before attaching to the remote process:

```json
        {
            "type": "PowerShell",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "PowerShell Attach to Host Process",
            "computerName": "my-remote-machine",
            "processId": "12345",
            "runspaceId": 1
        }
```

Please note that we currently do not yet support initiating remote sessions from Linux
or macOS.  This will be supported in an upcoming release.

#### Initial support for remote file opening using `psedit`

Another nice improvement is that we now support the `psedit` command in remote and
attached sessions.  This command allows you to open a file in a local or remote session
so that you can set breakpoints in it using the UI before launching it.  For now these
remotely-opened files will not be saved back to the remote session when you edit and
save them.  We plan to add this capability in the next feature update.

#### New "interactive session" debugging mode

You can now create a new launch configuration which drops you directly into the
debug console so that you can debug your scripts and modules however you wish.
You can call Set-PSBreakpoint to set any type of breakpoint and then invoke your
code through the console to see those breakpoints get hit.  This mode can also be
useful for debugging remote sessions.

![Interactive session config screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/22089502/5e56b4c6-dda0-11e6-8a51-f24e29ce7988.png)

Please note that this is NOT a replacement for a true interactive console experience.
We've added this debugging configuration to enable a few other debugging scenarios, like
debugging PowerShell modules, while we work on a true interactive console experience using
VS Code's Terminal interface.

#### New document symbol support for PSD1 files

We've extended our document symbol support to `.psd1` files to make it really easy to
navigate through them.  When you have a `.psd1` file open, run the `Go to Symbol in File...`
command (<kbd>Ctrl + Shift + O</kbd>) and you'll see this popup:

![psd1 symbol screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/22094872/85c7d9a2-ddc5-11e6-9bee-5fc8c3dae097.png)

You can type a symbol name or navigate using your arrow keys.  Once you select one of the
symbol names, the editor pane will jump directly to that line.

#### Other fixes and improvements

- Added a new `Open Examples Folder` command to easily open the extension's
  example script folder.
- Added a new setting `powershell.developer.powerShellExeIsWindowsDevBuild`
  which, when true, indicates that the `powerShellExePath` points to a Windows
  PowerShell development build.

#### Improved PowerShell session management

It's now much easier to manage the active PowerShell session.  We've added a
new item to the status bar to indicate the state of the session and the version
of PowerShell you're using:

![Screenshot of status indicator](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/21247551/fcf2777c-c2e4-11e6-9659-7349c35adbcd.png)

When this status item is clicked, a new menu appears to give you some session
management options:

![Screenshot of session menu](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/21247555/009fa64c-c2e5-11e6-8171-76914d3366a0.png)

You can restart the active session, switch between 32-bit and 64-bit PowerShell on
Windows or switch to another PowerShell process (like a 6.0 alpha build) that
you've configured with the `powershell.developer.powerShellExePath`.

We've also improved the overall experience of loading and using the extension:

- It will prompt to restart the PowerShell session if it crashes for any reason
- It will also prompt to restart the session if you change any relevant PowerShell
  configuration setting like the aforementioned  `powershell.developer.powerShellExePath`.
- You can easily access the logs of the current session by running the command
  `Open PowerShell Extension Logs Folder`.

#### Create new modules with Plaster

In this release we've added integration with the [Plaster](https://github.com/PowerShell/Plaster)
module to provide a `Create New Project from Plaster Template` command.  This command will
walk you through the experience of selecting a template and filling in all of
the project details:

![Screenshot of Plaster template selection](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/21247560/087b47a4-c2e5-11e6-86e7-ba3727b5e36d.png)

![Screenshot of Plaster input](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/21247562/0a79b130-c2e5-11e6-97e9-cfd672803f75.png)

We include one basic project template by default and will add more in the very
near future.  However, you won't need to update the PowerShell extension to get these
new templates, they will appear when you install an update to the Plaster module from
the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/).

Check out [Plaster's documentation](https://github.com/PowerShell/Plaster/tree/master/docs/en-US)
for more details on how it can be used and how you can create your own templates.

#### New "quick fix" actions for PSScriptAnalyzer rules

The PowerShell extension now uses any "suggested corrections" which are returned with
a rule violation in your script file to provide a "quick fix" option for the affected
section of code.  For example, when the `PSAvoidUsingCmdletAliases` rule finds the use
of a non-allowlisted alias, you will see a light bulb icon that gives the option to
change to the full name (right click or <kbd>Ctrl+.</kbd> on the marker):

![Screenshot of PSScriptAnalyzer quick fix](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/21247558/05887e86-c2e5-11e6-9c67-e4558a7e2dba.png)

If you'd like to see more quick fixes for PowerShell code, head over to the
[PSScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer) GitHub page and
get involved!

#### Easily enable and disable PSScriptAnalyzer rules

Another improvement related to PSScriptAnalyzer is the ability to change the active
PSScriptAnalyzer rules in the current editing session using a helpful selection menu:

![Screenshot of PSScriptAnalyzer rule selection](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/21247557/037888b6-c2e5-11e6-816f-6732e13cddb7.png)

You can enable and disable active rules by running the `Select PSScriptAnalyzer Rules`
command.  For now this only changes the active session but in a future release we will
modify your PSScriptAnalyzer settings file so that the changes are persisted to future
editing sessions.

#### New "hit count" breakpoints in the debugger

When debugging PowerShell scripts you can now set "hit count" breakpoints which
cause the debugger to stop only after the breakpoint has been encountered a specified
number of times.

![Screenshot of a hit count breakpoint](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/79405/21247563/0c159202-c2e5-11e6-8c91-36791c4fa804.png)

#### Other fixes and improvements

- We now provide snippets for the `launch.json` configuration file which make it easier
  to add new PowerShell debugging configurations for your project.
- In PowerShell `launch.json` configurations, the `program` parameter has now been
  renamed to `script`.  Configurations still using `program` will continue to work.
- Fixed #353: Cannot start PowerShell debugger on Windows when offline
- Fixed #217: PowerShell output window should be shown when F8 is pressed
- Fixed #292: Check for Homebrew's OpenSSL libraries correctly on macOS
- Fixed #384: PowerShell snippets broken in VS Code 1.8.0

## 0.7.2

#### Introducing support for Linux and macOS

This release marks the beginning of our support for Linux and macOS via
the new [cross-platform release of PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).
You can find installation and usage instructions at the [PowerShell GitHub repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

## 0.6.2
### Friday, August 12, 2016

- Fixed #231: In VS Code 1.4.0, IntelliSense has stopped working

- Fixed #182: Using 'Run Selection' on a line without a selection only runs to the cursor position
- Fixed #184: When running a script in the debugger, $host.Version reports wrong extension version

## 0.6.0
### Thursday, May 12, 2016

#### Added a new cross-editor extensibility model

- We've added a new extensibility model which allows you to write PowerShell
  code to add new functionality to Visual Studio Code and other editors with
  a single API.  If you've used `$psISE` in the PowerShell ISE, you'll feel
  right at home with `$psEditor`.  Check out the [documentation](https://powershell.github.io/PowerShellEditorServices/guide/extensions.html)
  for more details!

#### Support for user and system-wide profiles

- We've now introduced the `$profile` variable which contains the expected
  properties that you normally see in `powershell.exe` and `powershell_ise.exe`:
  - `AllUsersAllHosts`
  - `AllUsersCurrentHost`
  - `CurrentUserAllHosts`
  - `CurrentUserCurrentHost`
- In Visual Studio Code the profile name is `Microsoft.VSCode_profile.ps1`.
- `$host.Name` now returns "Visual Studio Code Host" and `$host.Version` returns
  the version of the PowerShell extension that is being used.

#### Other improvements

- IntelliSense for static methods and properties now works correctly.  If you
  type `::` after a type such as `[System.Guid]` you will now get the correct
  completion results.  This also works if you press `Ctrl+Space` after the `::`
  characters.
- `$env` variables now have IntelliSense complete correctly.
- Added support for new VSCode command `Debug: Start Without Debugging`.  Shortcut
  for this command is <kbd>Ctrl+F5</kbd>.
- Changed the keyboard shortcut for `PowerShell: Expand Alias` from <kbd>Ctrl+F5</kbd> to <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+e</kbd>.
- Added support for specifying a PSScriptAnalyzer settings file by
  providing a full path in your User Settings for the key `powershell.scriptAnalysis.settingsPath`.
  You can also configure the same setting in your project's `.vscode\settings.json`
  file to contain a workspace-relative path.  If present, this workspace-level setting
  overrides the one in your User Settings file. See the extension's `examples\.vscode\settings.json`
  file for an example.
- The debug adapter now does not crash when you attempt to add breakpoints
  for files that have been moved or don't exist.
- Fixed an issue preventing output from being written in the debugger if you
  don't set a breakpoint before running a script.

#### New configuration settings

- `powershell.scriptAnalysis.settingsPath`: Specifies the path to a PowerShell Script Analyzer settings file. Use either an absolute path (to override the default settings for all projects) or use a path relative to your workspace.

## 0.5.0
### Thursday, March 10, 2016

#### Support for PowerShell v3 and v4

- Support for PowerShell v3 and v4 is now complete!  Note that for this release,
  Script Analyzer support has been disabled for PS v3 and v4 until we implement
  a better strategy for integrating it as a module dependency

#### Debugging improvements

- Added support for command breakpoints.

  Hover over the Debug workspace's 'Breakpoints' list header and click the 'Add'
  button then type a command name (like `Write-Output`) in the new text box that
  appears in the list.

- Added support for conditional breakpoints.

  Right click in the breakpoint margin to the left of the code editor and click
  'Add conditional breakpoint' then enter a PowerShell expression in the text box
  that appears in the editor.

#### Other improvements

- Added a preview of a possible project template for PowerShell Gallery modules in
  the `examples` folder.  Includes a PSake build script with Pester test, clean,
  build, and publish tasks.  See the `examples\README.md` file for instructions.
  Check it out and give your feedback on GitHub!
- `using 'module'` now resolves relative paths correctly, removing a syntax error that
  previously appeared when relative paths were used
- Calling `Read-Host -AsSecureString` or `Get-Credential` from the console now shows an
  appropriate "not supported" error message instead of crashing the language service.
  Support for these commands will be added in a later release.

#### New configuration settings

- `powershell.useX86Host`: If true, causes the 32-bit language service to be used on 64-bit Windows.  On 32-bit Windows this setting has no effect.

## 0.4.1
### Wednesday, February 17, 2016

- Updated PSScriptAnalyzer 1.4.0 for improved rule marker extents
- Added example Pester task for running tests in the examples folder
- Fixed #94: Scripts fail to launch in the debugger if the working directory path contains spaces

## 0.4.0
### Tuesday, February 9, 2016

#### Debugging improvements

[@rkeithhill](https://github.com/rkeithhill) spent a lot of time polishing the script debugging experience for this release:

- You can now pass arguments to scripts in the debugger with the `args` parameter in launch.json
- You can also run your script with the 32-bit debugger by changing the `type` parameter in launch.json to "PowerShell x86" (also thanks to [@adamdriscoll](https://github.com/adamdriscoll)!)
- The new default PowerShell debugger configuration now launches the active file in the editor
- You can also set the working directory where the script is run by setting the `cwd` parameter in launch.json to an absolute path.  If you need a workspace relative path, use ${workspaceRoot} to create an absolute path e.g. `"${workspaceRoot}/modules/foo.psm1"`.

We recommend deleting any existing `launch.json` file you're using so that a new one will
be generated with the new defaults.

#### Console improvements

- Improved PowerShell console output formatting and performance
  - The console prompt is now displayed after a command is executed
  - Command execution errors are now displayed correctly in more cases
  - Console output now wraps at 120 characters instead of 80 characters

- Added choice and input prompt support
  - When executing code using the 'Run Selection' command, choice and input prompts appear as VS Code UI popups
  - When executing code in the debugger, choice and input prompts appear in the Debug Console

#### New commands

- "Find/Install PowerShell modules from the gallery" (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+F`): Enables you to find and install modules from the PowerShell Gallery (thanks [@dfinke](https://github.com/dfinke)!)
- "Open current file in PowerShell ISE" (`Ctrl+Shift+i`): Opens the current file in the PowerShell ISE (thanks [@janegilring](https://github.com/janegilring)!)

#### Editor improvements

- Path auto-completion lists show just the current directory's contents instead of the full path (which had resulted in clipped text)
- Parameter auto-completion lists are now sorted in the same order as they are in PowerShell ISE where command-specific parameters preceed the common parameters
- Parameter auto-completion lists show the parameter type
- Command auto-completion lists show the resolved command for aliases and the path for executables
- Many improvements to the PowerShell snippets, more clearly separating functional and example snippets (all of the latter are prefixed with `ex-`)
- Added some additional example script files in the `examples` folder

#### New configuration settings

- `powershell.developer.editorServicesLogLevel`: configures the logging verbosity for PowerShell Editor Services.  The default log level will now write less logs, improving overall performance
